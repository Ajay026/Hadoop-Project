Their specialty are mousse drinks - which we had no idea what exactly it was. So when we asked the staff, they said it was some sort of cheese. \n\nFor a Sunday afternoon, they were also out of grass jelly and pudding, which are ingredients in quite a few of their drinks (so not sure how that works).\n\nThe service is really bad, they don't understand English so when you asked them about the menu items, they can't really explain what they are.\n\nWe had ordered the following:\n- slush mango (came with tapioca and mousse)\n- peach ice tea\n- roasted oolong milk tea\n- supernova kumquat lemonade\n\nAnd when we asked what the difference between a supernova kumquat lemonade under the galaxy drinks section (which are supposed to be layered drinks), and the kumquat lemonade, they said it had a layer of blue mousse - so we were like ok we will try it then. But what came was just a bigger cup size of the kumquat lemonade. When we asked them again, they said it was just a size difference, that's what makes it supernova - which is pretty dumb to me as on the menu both items had the same two size choices of regular or large. \n\nThe mango slush and the roasted oolong milk tea wasn't bad. But the other two was not that great. The tea had a big floral taste that overpowered everything. There was no peach taste in the peach ice tea. The kumquat one had no kumquat taste and was just bitter from the lime and it tasted like it had no sugar in it at all.\n\nI guess if you need a non-busy place to use WIFI and work, then this is the place, no one wants to come here.\n\nAlso - their gimmick also seems to be the lightbulb drinks, which were intriguing to us, but you are not allowed to take the lightbulb home...\n\nWe will definitely not be returning...","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

SO GOOD that it melts in your mouth - so soft and tender. If it wasn't because we had ordered so much food and this was the last main course that showed up, we would have devoured it.\n\nFor dessert, we had ordered the Foie and Nutella, as we thought this was very interesting.

I have had plenty of bad manicures before, so I know what a bad job looks like. Just don't go expecting someone to fuss over you, or give you plenty of conversation. English is not the first language and I have never felt the need to force conversation. \nIn this past year I have noticed a huge increase in the number of people that go to this spa, so they seem to be doing quite well. I have never had to wait more than ten minutes for service though and I'm happier they are busy because it means they are doing well and will stay in business.

I have had so many bad experiences at this place, I just need to give up on it. \n\nA few years ago, Sheppard Centre was an alright place. When I lived at Yonge and Sheppard, there was a grocery store across the street and all the basics you would need st Sheppard Centre and it was good. \n\nSheppard Centre is at a major subway stop, in a hugely busy area, but somehow stores keep failing here. \n\nThat being the case, there are a few stores that are nice and handy. I would consider this mall for errands, now that I live away...except that the major reason for coming is gone now.\n\nSheppard Centre used to have 1 hour of free parking, which is a huge draw. You could go and park, run in and pick up your mail, or something from Shoppers Drug Mart and be on your way. They got rid of that. Not only that, but it's $3.50 for half an hour or under!\n\nI think this is pretty pathetic for a crappy mall. \n\n\"OH, but they have to pay for their excellent staff!\" you say?\n\nYeah, let me tell you about the staff that work there. First of all, you should also know that the ticket machine to pay for your parking tickets likes to break down ALL THE TIME, so you have to go to the parking garage and drive up to the ticket booth, park in the non-parking spots, block traffic and go in and pay the guys sitting around in the office...an office with TV screens of the parking garage, where our car has been broken into before...but it's not their fault. There are SIGNS that say they are not liable. Soooo...what are the TV screens for? To WATCH peoples' cars get broken into and laugh?\n\nRight, so back to the story! \n\nBefore I knew what to do when the machines broke down, I went to the in-mall security\/info booth to ask. The guy was behind the booth, on the phone, having a personal conversation. He saw me, but turned away and continued for ten minutes. Finally he got off the phone and made like he was coming over...only to turn away at the last second and start going through some papers. Finally I called out and said, \"Excuse me?\" He told me he was busy and made a point of moving towards me as slowly as possible.\n\nThis isn't the only time a staff member has been rude to me before. Dogs are allowed in the subway, so I was walking through once, to the subway entrance, HOLDING my dog, in my arms and a security guard chased me down to tell me dogs are not allowed.

We booked a trip through gate1travel.com and when you are booking they give you the options for hotels. The default booking is for Circus Circus, NOT Circus, Circus Manor Motor Lodge. It says three stars and even says this on gate1's travel site: \"The rooms are fitted with contemporary decor and furnishings. All rooms are equipped with amenities that will be sure to make your stay pleasant, such as internet access (surcharge), a hair dryer, and a television with cable channels.\"\nWe looked up Circus Circus, saw it was nothing special, but alright and went for it...and found out that in fact, we were in the Manor Motor Lodge.\nNow, I KNOW that this is gate1's fault and I'll be taking it up with them as well. Also, I want to point out that on my second night, I complained and they put us in a suite for the night, so this is nothing against the overall hotel, but there are still a few things people need to know staying here.\nRooms: They are DUMPS in the manor motor lodge. I asked, when we were checking in, if those rooms had been redone at all and was told that \"all the rooms have been updated in SOME way\"...well I don't know what way this room had been updated. The carpets were worn and stained. The bedding was the polyester crap from the 80s. The wallpaper was stained and peeling off the walls. The bathroom floor had cracks in the tile and a permanent grunge that could never been cleaned. It looked like a motel room you see in horror movies!\nThe hallways were constantly loud and smelled of marijuana, with cheap, apple air freshener over top, which was interesting because of the number of small children running around with distinctly trashy families. I even made a joke with a cab driver in Las Vegas, that we were NOT ugly enough to be staying in this hotel. He agreed and said it was the butt of the joke of cabbies on the strip. Good to know.\n\nHotel: The hotel amenities are geared towards children, but are basically a money grab. There is a small, indoor amusement park that costs something like $8\/30 second ride. There are shops and restaurants, but non are high end. We ate at three places while there and overall they were crappy. I'll give those individual ratings though.\n\nService: This was very good actually. I had a very pleasant bell hop help us out and all the wait staff and cleaning staff were very nice and the woman whom I complained to was very receptive and polite, so that earns them an extra star.\n\nThe thing with the hotel is that even these rooms we were stuck in, fall under 3 stars, even though they, by themselves, would barely qualify as 1 star rooms, because the whole hotel falls under one heading.\n\nSO, lesson to be learned, these rooms are NOT nice rooms. The hotel is considerably crappier than other hotels. It's also quite far from the main strip. BUT it is cheap. If you are (for whatever God-awful reason) bringing children to Vegas, I guess this would fit the bill. Otherwise, if you're just looking for a bed and a cheap one, this also fits the bill. The beds, I will say, had clean sheets and were comfortable. But don't be fooled into thinking you're getting this amazing deal on a three star hotel. You're not. You're getting an average deal, on 1 star accommodations.","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":1}

It's fine...it's not great!\n\nWe went here on a Saturday night. It's literally a block away from where we live and we have somehow never been. We finally decided to go for it!\n\nThe atmosphere is fine. It's nice and clean and much larger than you would realize from the outside. The decor it a bit cheesy with faux Roman sculptures. \n\nService was very good. The waiter was quick with our drinks and food and was helpful with suggestions. \n\nNow to the food. My husband ordered the veal parm and I ordered a pasta with chicken. We ordered brushetta as a starter. I noticed from the menu that, while a lot of selection, many of the pasta dishes were a bit uninspired. A lot of very basic dishes. Pasta with mushrooms and red sauce, or pasta with shrimp and pesto, etc. I really enjoy creative combinations and flavours when I go to an Italian restaurant, because quite honestly, I can make the basic stuff at home...for a hell of a lot cheaper.\n\nThat said, the pasta dishes were solid, if nothing special. My pasta was well cooked, but the chicken tasted like something you would find in a McDonald's salad and the mushrooms were good, but that was the basis of the dish. My husband's was basic, but veal parms usually are. He did note that there was a LOT of sauce on his. There was, but I like that personally, if there is bread to dip into it...but no bread was served to our table, other than the bread from our brushetta. \n\nThe brushetta wasn't great. The tomato mixture on top was good, but the bread wasn't properly toasted, so it got soggy and couldn't hold its shape. It kept falling apart when you picked it up. \n\nThe desserts really brought this place back for me. I had their homemade creme brule and it was really excellent. On the menu it tells you which are made in-house and I would highly recommend getting one of those. \n\nOverall, it was quite expensive for pretty basic Italian food, so it didn't stun me. I'm not opposed to going back, but it's not my first choice. My major reason for going back will be for convenience, because it is so close to us.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

It was much more akin to ice cream and the flavour selection wasn't huge. \n\nThat said, they have some interesting flavours. I personally tried Twix and birthday cake and they were both very good. The more traditional flavour I tried (creme caramel) was a little boring and lacked flavour. \n\nMy husband had the strawberry, Skor and chocolate. All fine, none blew me away.\n\nOkay, so the gelato is good, if not the \"best\"! But perhaps that's being picky. If I'm in the area and want some dessert, this place is great and I can imagine in the summer it's fantastic.\n\nSo why the three stars?? First of all you can only get gelato in two sizes - regular and large. There is no small option and both of those options are quite large. If you only want a taste of gelato, there is no option for you! \n\nSecondly, although this place is named for it's gelato, it also specializes in cupcakes. We got a cupcake to bring home. When asked if we would like it packaged to bring home we said yes...and they threw it in a bag. The girl apologized and said they had nothing appropriate to package it in. Why did you offer then?? But furthermore, YES YOU DO! You literally have perfectly shaped round cups to put gelato in everywhere! Guess what shape cupcakes are??\n\nOh well, no biggie.\n\nSo, since this place is about the gelato and the cupcakes, you may be interested in the cupcakes...well the taste was overall good, but it was a very oily cupcake. The icing especially. The cake was moist, which is good...except it was SO moist the cake was just falling apart everywhere! \n\nSo what's the final synopsis. This place isn't bad. It has some delicious options. But nothing is perfect and in fact there are a number of flaws, which prevent me from giving it a better score. We'll see how I feel if it's a boiling hot summer day and I go in there for gelato though...I may be singing a different tune!","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

The manager was brought out and she was immediately snarky and rude towards me. She said she wouldn't accept a charm that was \"all worn and beat up\". I encouraged her to look at the charm. She could clearly see it was in pristine condition. She glanced at my bracelet as a whole, but did not look at the charm, instead insisting that she could tell.\n\nSeriously lady, you don't stand by your product at all?

The pork was pure fat and while it wasn't gristly, it was SO greasy, the grease positively dripped all over your hands. It was hugely unappetizing. I couldn't taste the cucumbers and didn't see any evidence of scallions. It was basically just pure fat, wrapped in a bland \"bun\". So I guess if you enjoy really fatty, greasy appetizers, this is the right deal. (Really, I can't stress enough how fatty the pork was...it was purely, white, greasy fat! Either change the name of the dish to pork fat buns, or please add some actual pork!)\n\nThe noodles however, were quite good and I liked the flavour combinations. I had the dan dan noodles, which is spicy pork, dried scallops and peanuts. I enjoyed that you could really taste the peanuts. I was a little disappointed that the pork was ground pork, instead of shredded pork. It made the dish seem cheaper and less inspired. \n\nI liked the atmosphere, but the seating is at long tables and so you share the space with whoever they place next to you. The seats are long benches, so if you're in the middle of the bench, you have to lift your leg over...I saw guys struggling to do this...now imagine being a girl, wearing a skirt and having to do this. No graceful way to go about that!\n\nTo be honest, this place just didn't blow me away enough to make a conscious effort to return.

One of the major problems was finding it though. Almost every one in our party either didn't see it initially (it's sort of nondescript looking), or weren't sure which door\/staircase was the proper one to get inside. \nOnce inside though, it's an eclectic blend of vintage meets white-washed industrial. If you didn't know that was a style, neither did I, but it totally works. There was a great blend of music in the background...it was a mix, probably an employee just made it, but it was great mood music. I want that mix CD! \nMy brother had called several weeks ago to make a reservation and somehow they didn't have it. Apparently it's an answering service for reservations and they say they call you back if they can't accommodate you. He never received a call back, so the assumption was that the reservation was alright. Unfortunately, as I said, there was no reservation. The staff apologized profusely though and luckily there was space and they set up a table for us right away. \nWe ordered from the drink menu and I will say that they drinks are very expensive. The wine is what you would expect and the mixed drink (at least the one I had, the Smith Lemonade) was fantastic, but it was also $12, which is steep even for Toronto bar standards. \nAs I said, we ordered from the Summerlicious menu. I have heard many comments online that people are feeling disillusioned with Summerlicious because so many restaurants give you the cheapest options and it's not worth the cost. This was NOT the case with Smith at all. There were several great options to choose from and the food was excellent. I had the curried carrot soup, which was spicy but great. Every one else in my party also enjoyed their various appetizers. My main course was a Georgian Bay whitefish, which was done perfectly, just crispy enough on the outside and flaky on the inside. The pork chops were also raved about. There was also a risotto, which two of the three people who ordered it really enjoyed. You can't take that last guy (brother again) too seriously, since he's a very picky eater. \nThe desserts were all good, however the fudge ice cream, is really just chocolate ice cream, nothing special. The lemon curd tasted like lemon pie filling and was delicious and the bread pudding was heavenly! Seriously, it was SO good. \nI think everyone left feeling really satisfied. \nIt did take a long time to get the food. This wasn't a problem for us, since we were there to converse and I understand that great food may take some time, but if you are really hungry, or looking for a quicker meal, this isn't the right choice.\nBasically it lost of star because of the lost reservation and lack of visibility from the street. Also, we weren't thrilled with the washrooms. Besides the fact that they are co-ed, which is a little weird, there is one, large sink and a foot peddle to operate it. Since only one person can step on it at a time, you have to wait for that person to finish, before you can wash your hands, which starts to cause a bit of a back-up if more than two people are in the washroom. Also, the hand dryers were weak\/not working. \nThat said, I wouldn't let a slightly annoying bathroom stop me from coming here! This is a nice, little place!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1}

I spoke to the hostess and a manager came out and graciously moved us, which was very nice of them, because apparently many people call and reserve specific seats! \n\nI have walked by this restaurant a million times and never known it was there. It is directly on Bloor, but in a small \"mall\" which houses The Japanese Foundation and some other businesses. The restaurant is on the second floor and there are no readily visible signs on the street, so you would never think to just walk into this place...maybe that's the point! \n\nThe decor of the restaurant is really lovely. They have a huge, stain glass ceiling and dark wooden furniture and Art Nouveau decor. The bathrooms are large, individually sectioned off stall, with white and black tiles everywhere and large, vintage, French ads on the walls. \n\nTwo of our party ordered from the Winterlicious menu, one ordered from the regular menu and I ordered from their regular Prix Fixe menu, which they have available all the time and is $7 more than the Winterlicious. \n\nThey were also offering some Winterlicious cocktails...I had three (the same one) and they were excellent. \n\nOur appetizers included two salads, which looked great and (according to the orderes) were. My husband ordered the onion soup from the Winterlicious menu and it was great and I ordered the mushroom soup from the prix fixe and it was excellent!\n\nThe main courses included steak from the regular menu, which were ordered with steak frites. The steak was a nice cut of meat, prepared exactly as asked and the steak frites were served with a garlic aioli (which we all tried) and was really good!\n\nThe lasagna and pork belly were ordered from the Winterlicious menu. Lasagna came in a rounded dish, where it had been baked and was on the smaller side, but satisfying within a three course meal. My husband had the pork belly from the Winterlicious menu and I tried that. The sauce on it and the tenderness of the pork were really nice. \n\nI had the pistachio chicken, which was a huge dish! The chicken breast was served on top of another cut of chicken, but in dark meat. Both had pistachios on top and delicious sauces drizzled along the bottom of the plate and a few apple slices as garnish. I couldn't finish two pieces of chicken and I stuck mostly with the white meat, but it was a nice option to have to two and I tried the dark and it was really excellent as well! \n\nThe reason I chose the prix fixe menu over the Winterlicious, was because of the dessert. The Winterlicious had the pistachio chicken as a main and the onion soup was an option for the appetizer, but the desserts set the prix fixe apart. On the Winterlicious menu the option was a rhubarb crumble, or chocolate mousse. Neither of which I really cared for, although I tried it from my husband and it was good. On the prix fixe menu you have a choice of creme brule (which I have heard good things about) and a sticky toffee cake. I asked the waitress what she recommended and she said the sticky toffee, because it was such a lovely, winter dessert. I had been set on the creme brule, but you know what....brules are a dime a dozen. How many places have sticky, toffee cake? \n\nI was NOT disappointed. The cake was amazing! It was a small, singular bundt cake, topped with a toffee crisp and a small scoop of caramel ice cream and surrounded on the plate with warm, caramel. It was decadent and delicious. \n\nFinally I'll mention that our server was lovely and attentive and not a single person in our party were disappointed in any way. We all left very happy and satisfied. \n\nThis place is a little on the pricier end (would have been less so except for the three drinks myself and my friend had and the beers that the guys had), but it's great for a nice night out, or a romantic date. \n\nI will definitely come back some time in the future.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1}

Some of the friends has heard that this place KNOWS their wine and ordered a bottle of chianti, which was great (and I'm not a huge wine drinker). \nThe ladies I was with ordered two caesar salads to share amongst the four of them and the waitress brought them out the salads already split on individual plates, garnished with a garlic bread crouton. I don't think the salads were anything special, but I find that caesar salads in general aren't, so peoples' complaints about them below seem largely unfounded. \nI ordered the baked goat cheese appetizer...OMG it was SO good. Goat cheese and grilled veggies on top of a portobello mushroom cap, with some sort of sauce and with salad and shredded carrots and balsamic reduction....to DIE for. \nFor my main I ordered the Penne Gorgonzola, which was also fabulous! The members of my partied ordered the veal parmesan (but grilled veggies instead of the pasta), the salmon with a lobster brandy cream sauce, a NY striploin and fettucine and everyone loved their food. One woman I was with IS a chef, so I feel like that was saying something. \nNow, since I didn't taste their dishes, I can only expand on my own. The sauce was to DIE for. Creamy, complex and delicious. The pairing of veggies with prosciutto and cheese was excellent. I would order that dish again in a heartbeat! \nSince we were having a good time and the food had met our expectations, we went for it and ordered dessert (even though we were all stuffed). We all ordered the white chocolate creme br√ªl√©e, except one friend who ordered the tiramisu and were once again not disappointed. Our creme br√ªl√©es were crackly on the outside and creamy on the inside. Perfect! The tiramisu was apparently great, served very untraditionally in a large plate, with an indentation like a bowl in the middle. \nI was also pleased to find out that they serve caffeine-free cappuccinos, so we all ordered those as well and it was served with a little almond biscotti and was great!\n\nAltogether my meal came to $50 (tip included), which I think is more than I would spend on a normal dinner out, but not crazy. Also note though that I did not pay for the wine and did not order any other drinks. That would obviously have increased the price. \n\nThe restaurant atmosphere is nothing special, but I'm disenchanted with the trendy spaces and pretentiously presented food that isn't half as good, so this wasn't a concern for me. The restaurant was clean and comfy, but the furniture was a little on the older side (like the dining chairs you would see in your fussy grandmother's home) and fake paintings on the walls.   \n\nThe service was excellent. Our waitress saw to our every need, answered all our questions and came over to chat and make sure we were happy and comfortable regularly. \n\nSo, was it perfect? Well as I said, the salad was probably just average and the atmosphere also just average, but those did not pose major problems. I would ultimately give this place 4-1\/2, but since I can't and this leaned more to the good than anything remotely bad, it gets a 5! I would go back in a heartbeat!","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I asked the server if it was processed cheese, or \"real\" cheese in the sandwich and he had no idea what I was talking about. I tried to clarify by saying, \"Is it like Kraft single slices, or deli cheese?\" He said it was \"good\". This really should have been a sign and I could probably fault the waiter for this, since you SHOULD know what you're serving, but he was so sweet, I couldn't be mad!\n\nMy husband ordered a hot dog of sorts.\n\nI asked if there was a way to substitute fries for a salad. There was not, but the server hooked me up and brought me a salad anyway (no charge). I asked for sweet potato fries with the sandwich.\n\nOf course, my sandwich was made with plasticy, processed cheese, that was melted to the point of Cheeze-Wiz and was inedible. I took one bite of the sandwich and couldn't do another.

I went home and took the polish off.

I went in and sat down the a woman with an Eastern European accent  came to talk with me. I showed her a picture of what I wanted and she showed me various hair dye samples....none of which looked like my picture, but I always assume the hair dressers know what's best. Now, you're all thinking, \"..and she did a poor job and you hated the colour...\" right? \nNope, she told me she couldn't do my hair because I had lice! Of course I freaked out. Another hair dresser came over to see if I was alright and I was mortified. She asked if I had experienced any itching. I said no. This hairdresser turned back to the original hairdresser and asked if maybe it wasn't too bad yet, but original hairdresser said it was really, really bad. I freaked out and left (obviously without having anything done) and went to a Shoppers and bought lice shampoo. I went home and had my husband look at my hair. He looked and looked and could find nothing. I still didn't want to take chances, so we tore the house apart and washed and bagged everything and I went to a walk-in clinic. The doctor looked at my head and ALSO said there was nothing there! \nSince I was paranoid, I still used the shampoo and anytime my head itched in the slightest I went to examine it. But even with my husband and mother looking at my head, we never found a single thing. We didn't even see dandruff!! I went to a hairdresser a week later and they told me my hair was beautiful...but dry at the ends...yeah, because of the chemical-filled lice shampoo! Thanks a lot you crazy woman!\nSo ultimately, I never had lice. I don't know if this woman just decided she didn't feel like doing my hair, or if she was delusional, but I sure won't be going back there EVER again.

So I'm always on the lookout for new cupcake places. I was in Scarborough Town Centre and came upon this kiosk. It's not a storefront, but a rather ingenious booth, with colourful signs and a glass showcase full of cupcakes. \n\nThere is a long list of flavours and I suspect (as with many places) they make different cupcakes for different days. \n\nI ordered 6, which was $18...I know, it's steep, that's pretty standard. Cupcake places seem to range from around the $2.25 mark to around $4\/cupcake. So these guys fall somewhere inbetween. But not cheap, so I expect excellence, needless to say.\n\nNow, here's the strange thing. On their website each cupcake is listed as $2.90....was this the case at the store?? I sure hope not. Why would you have to pay MORE for buying more? Maybe it's an ordering online thing? Anyway, my GUESS is that you're paying $3\/cupcake at the store, or $18 for 6. No real incentive to buy 6. But I did, so moving on....\n\nOf course I chose a range of flavours: oreo cookie. chocolate with vanilla icing, salted caramel, lemon and a double chocolate. \n\nOver two days we managed to work our way through them (myself and my husband) and I nibbled the different flavours. Lemon was my favorite, by far, with the salted caramel being a huge disappointment. It was entirely too salty. More salt than caramel. It wasn't very good at all.\n\nBut that said, none of the cupcakes really blew me away. AND in fact, they were VERY stale the next day, despite being stored in an airtight container, in the fridge. Luckily, the cold buttercream frosting was easy to scoop off and once they had been in the oven for a few minutes, they softened up a bit. \n\nThe bottoms of the cupcakes stuck to the wrappers and the flavours were dull tasting and uninspired. \n\nI was also surprised at the lack of creativity in terms of Christmas flavours or designed. Right before Christmas you would expect some special flavours...maybe a candy cane, or gingerbread cupcake. It would be so easy to switch out one flavour and try to get people to consider your product for a Christmas party dessert. \n\nHaving a little kiosk in a mall is a smart idea. Sadly, this business is not one I think I will bother with again!","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

The other appetizer was similar to an Indian samosa (similar name too, but I can't remember exactly what it was called). They were stuff with lentils and had a flaky shell. They were DELICIOUS. BUT, their appetizers were only made for three people, so there were only three of them! Seems silly when you offer a four person deal. \nWe each ordered a different main course and they brought them on one large platter, so we could all share.

They're nothing special, but they're only used as a sort of utensil, because you use it to scoop up the food. The food was delicious! I especially liked the chickpea dish. Every one of us ended up liking a different dish the best! Worked out well. I personally found the beef dish very tough though. \nOnce we were stuff with the food, we ordered two desserts. We especially liked the cheesecake (which is obviously not Ethiopian). \nWe asked if they had any Ethiopian coffees and they said yes. THey showed us the beans, as they were being roasted.

(Not insulting, we just got a laugh). \nNothing was cheap and then we had to wait a long time again to get our bill and pay. This was all strange because the restaurant was not particularly busy.\nBecause the brunch itself didn't blow me away, food shortages and service, I'm not sure if I would bother with brunch again. Oliver and Bonicini in the actual mall has a much better brunch. I might try this again for lunch or dinner though.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Apparently it is MY fault they sent the wrong thing, because I sent an email and then followed it up with a phone call...which confused them and made them think there were two orders or something. Which makes zero sense, because two orders were not sent. And the person I was speaking with on the phone responded to the emails I sent with codes to try out....so I have a hard time believing that they were confused by what was going on and thought that the phone order and email order were different. \n\nThey also told me they blocked me on instagram because I was body shaming their models. I want to be VERY clear on this. I never once body shamed, or made any comments on instagram about their models. I asked why they were promoting clothing they don't even have in stock on instagram...apparently that equates to body shaming to them. \n\nThey also informed me that because they had to mail so many orders to me (3), they were going to start to charge me for shipping. They seemed to forget that I had also been paying to ship items back to them and that I had specifically chosen times when they had free shipping promos taking place to place orders. It's not that they weren't charging me for shipping...it was that I was taking advantage of their own promos. Apparently I can't use their promos anymore, because they have placed an arbitrary rules on how many times you can make a return now. At least for me. \n\nThey did not address the code not working. \n\nI responded and expressed continued frustration at their lack of ownership over their mistakes and how poor their customer service continued to be. \n\nThen I did some research and sent another email. Instead of returning the dress I would donate it to Dress for Success. I said this seemed like a better choice than continuing to mail clothing back and forth. My request to them was that they take the would be money they would spend on continuing to mail me clothing and take some ownership for their mistakes and channel it into something good. I asked that they take the remaining $9.98 credit I had and put it towards them making a small donation, either monetarily or a piece of clothing, also to the charity. I stated that their continued neglect for customer service and lack of ownership over repeated problems should be owned up to, but if they wouldn't do it for me, perhaps they would be willing to do so for someone in need. I said that would conclude our business and bring something good out of this ridiculousness. \n\nA few hours later I received an email with a letter of thanks for a donation made to Dress for Success...for the amount of $10 via the store....so my remainder amount I had paid for and Big Sis Closet's contribution of....two cents. Their generosity is astounding. NOW, I don't know that they haven't made their own donation and just not told me of course...I'll let you guys decide whether you want to give them the benefit of the doubt in that regard. But given that they have taken zero responsibility for the continued poor management and customer service, well...I think you can guess what my thoughts are on the subject. No further correspondence was sent from the actual store. \n\nBut at any rate, I am donating the new dress to Dress for Success (along with my $9.98) and I am officially done with this store for good. And I sincerely hope that people read this review and think twice about shopping here. The clothes are not good quality, but more than that...I have NEVER experienced such insanely bad management and customer service in my life. Zero regard for their customers, zero regard for their own mistakes, zero regard for taking ownership of...anything! Just excuse after excuse and then turning the blame around on their customers. These people do not deserve your business and quite frankly...ladies you deserve better. Better clothing (I have now purchased 6 items and been dissatisfied with the quality of all of them...loose threads, flimsy, cheap fabric, wrong stitching for the fabric, no lining, incorrect fit for size, etc.) and a greater degree of respect as a consumer.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Finally...La Revolucion answered!\n\nWe walked in and were greeted with....a dishwasher, sitting in the middle of the floor. Sort of strange...maybe some kitchen renos? We walked to meet our friends and their table and were informed that the reservations were not made, or were forgotten and the waitress had had to kick out a single guy from the table and he was eating at the bar. Maybe he was lucky, because the table was SO sticky underneath that my shoes were sticking to the ground. I mean STICKING!\n\nShe took our drink orders and then gave us our drinks and walked away. It took us another 15 minutes before we could place our order. Around the table we ordered two burritos, one plate of tacos and one quesadilla and guacamole bites (which is basically nachos and guac). \n\nThe guac came out fast, and was quite good, but we then waited for almost forty minutes for our food!\n\nBurritos were a bit bland. Needs some sauce in, or on top. Quesadillas were the same...nothing special. The tacos got favorable reviews, but again, nothing to write home about. \n\nThe back area houses a sort of club-like atmosphere, which is described in blogto as: \"...dark textured walls and ambient lighting, it is the opposite of its cocina counterpart. Records adorn the walls and instruments lay strewn about, giving it a relaxed basement rec-room vibe...July will see live music on Thursdays and Fridays with open jam Tuesdays. Flamenco Saturdays are in the works...\"\n\nWhen we were there (on a Saturday) there was a sign out front for a \"dance party\". The lights were down in the back, with a sort of laser light show and early 90s hip hop music was playing. There were about three, older guys there, just hanging out, drinking. It seemed totally out of place. The music didn't match, certainly wasn't flamenco and that's a weird rec room vibe...if that's even something you would want in a restaurant.\n\nI think this place has potential. People in the area like it and it has a nice vibe to it...or would, had we had better service and less stickiness and washers sitting around. I feel like the space is just not being utilized and that's a shame. \n\nI WOULD have giving this place two stars, but the extra star was a result of the sangria, which is their \"secret recipe\" and were amazing. I had two actually.\n\nAnyway, if I was in the area, I might stop in again, as everything was fine, but I don't think I'll be making any special trips to go there in the future.

My friend ordered the salad and the soup and I ordered the calamari sandwich and soup as the side. The sandwich had some great aioli on it and the calamari was nicely done, however I wasn't a huge fan of the bun it was in. It had a sort of sweet taste you might enjoy as a french toast, but not with something savoury and some of the calamari was a little tough. THat said, the sauces covered the taste from the bread and the texture was good and overall it was tasty.\n\nThe soup I found to have too much black pepper mixed in. The waitress asked and I mentioned and she brought back a small container with grated parmesan cheese and suggested I mix some in, because it cuts the pepper taste. \n\nShe was right!

I've never had charcuterie before and I'm not generally a big meat eater, so this was a little out of the box. That said, I like trying to be adventurous and trying new things, so when are visiting friends suggested we give it a go, we went for it. Dinner service is open at 6pm, so we agreed we'd arrive at 6pm. We got there at about 6:15....there was already a HUGE wait for a table, but we managed to wrangle seats at the bar. \n\nThe four of us ordered a bunch of dishes to split between ourselves. We tried the charcuterie (sort of a platter of assorted sliced meats and p√¢t√©), horse tar tar, roasted bone marrow, pork carnitas tacos, tongue on brioche and the foie gras and nutella for dessert. \n\nThe dishes came out staggered, so we got to sit around chatting and enjoying ourselves and our cocktails. The charcuterie came out first. It was assorted sliced meats arranged on a wood plank and served with bread. It was actually really nice. Next was the horse tar tar. This was a stretch for me. I don't generally like to eat animals that I LIKE. The people I was with convinced me to try a small bit and I must say, it tasted pretty good, but on principle, I just have trouble with it. Sorry! I hate being one of those people who doesn't have a problem killing the \"ugly\" animals, but doesn't want the cute ones to die...but I am. \n\nNext was the bone marrow, which was....well let's just say I had to keep telling myself not to think about what I was eating. Basically, it's a big bone and the marrow is of course in the middle and has been cooked so that it's almost the consistency of warm butter...pretty fatty and oily looking. You scoop it out with a spoon and put it on bread. It's actually delicious, but feels like you're eating something you shouldn't, purely for health reasons if nothing else! It feels like eating pure fat....tastes as good I suppose. \n\nWe had the tongue on brioche, which I was only okay with. The tongue was sliced and presented as a sort of Montreal smoked meat. We were told to open it up and eat it like an open faced sandwich. This made it easier to split certainly. The meat itself was very tender and the brioche was great, but the meat had a horseradish (I think) sauce, which was a bit overpowering. \n\nFinally we had the tacos, which was probably the more \"normal\" thing we had. I actually thought those were my favorite. Wish it was one of the more exciting things, but nope. Those tacos were excellent. \n\nThe foie gras with nutella was also delicious. It was served on a banana bread, over a nutella spread...but the fois gras was superflous. It didn't add any taste and was overpowered but the nutella and basically didn't add anything to the dish. Could have been served without. Clearly just added to SAY it was there. \n\nSo what's the overall opinion? Well, the restaurant is too small. It's REALLY small, but popular. Wish it was in a bigger location. Sitting at the bar was kind of interesting, because all the cooking was done behind the bar, but that was a small workspace and it got hot, because the oven, dishwasher, stove top and so forth were always turned up very hight. Impressive how they work in such a space though.\n\nOverall the food was very good. SOMEONE knows what they are doing. However, it is quite a pricey place and as I said, sometimes the flavours overpower the meat, or the meat just isn't even necessary. Sometimes you're paying extra for fancy meat dishes that don't even need the meat, or where you can't TASTE the meat. \n\nThose are the only criticisms, but I wouldn't let that keep you from trying this place...but only if you're willing to go out on a limb a bit and as something different. This isn't a go-to place, but it's a fun place to have gone to! \n\nOh...PS - They don't accept credit cards. Only debit or cash.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Had heard good things, which is why we chose Second City, as opposed to the cheaper Bad Dog Theatre. \n\nI should mention that it was a lot less improv than I expected. I wasn't entirely sure what to expect, but it was basically, short, individual skits, creating a sort of sketch comedy act, as opposed to improv. This isn't a bad thing. I'm a HUGE fan of SNL, but I was say that I probably laughed more consistently during this performance, than your average episode of SNL. This is because of a combination of personal \"current Toronto\" jokes and because that's the way it should be when you have a couple of months to be putting together your next show, as opposed to one week (as with SNL). I would only expect a more refined show. In addition, we came close to the end of this show's run, so the kinks would presumably be figured out and they told us they were testing some of the new material on us, so that was kind of cool! \n\nThe skits were mostly successful, none failed to make us laugh out loud at least once. There were no weak links in terms of the actors, but the stand outs (for me) were a red headed girl and the black guy....sorry I have no names! I can only go by really obvious characteristics. \n\nWe stuck around after, as they did a little bit of actual improv and another skit, which seemed like an idea they were trying to hash out a little more. Well worth the sticking around even later for!\n\nWhy the lack of one star? Well those pictures down below don't really accurately describe what this place looks like when it's full of people. The chairs are small, there is no coat check and you're all crammed around a very small table.

My skirt made it so that I kept sliding off the seat! I asked if there was any way we could be moved into regular seats, but the only thing left (and this is how I know seats are prearranged, because there were tonnes of empty seats all around at that time), were right in the front, next to the stage, but to the far side. From this angle, you can't see everything, but we enjoyed it more being right up, near the action. \n\nThat said, it was still VERY crowded and uncomfortable. Tickets are $30 each (here is a tip...it's a little less if you have a CAA membership and order through them), so that's pretty pricey. The show makes it worth it, it truly does. The seating takes away from it. \n\nBUT you can order drinks, which we did and that make just about anything better, so hey! \n\nAt the end of the day, I'll just make sure I wear pants next time and order tickets further in advance and either way it won't stop me from checking out another performance. It's worth a night of non-stop laughter.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

This is a challenge, because you can't see the food and because even when you THINK you've finally speared a veggie, for example, when you bring the fork to your mouth, you realized you've lost it somewhere along the way. Usually into your lap. \n\nThis is DEFINITELY an experience, does an interesting job at raising awareness, but here are my issues with this place: The food was good, but not great.

This was distinctly forgettable food. \n\nI would have liked to see the room we were in at the end of the meal. YES, I know this would require everyone eating at the same time, no new people entering, but I was a little sketched out about never seeing where I was.

It's boring. The booths had gaps where the seat meets with the wooden bench part that holds the seat part up. Hard to describe, but looks cheap and crappy, like they're broken. Our table was very unbalanced and the waitress came and stuck a coaster under it so it would stop rocking. It's small and very cramped. \n\nFood: Selection was pretty standard pub fare, but a bit on the expensive side. I ordered a chicken curry dish and when they asked if I wanted it to be spicy or mild I asked for it to be mild. Either their mild is just VERY spicy and I would hate to try their actual spicy, or they made a mistake. The curry comes with the chicken in sauce, rice and a sort of fried crisp, which was nice. The rice was bland however...or the spice from the curry killed my tastebuds. \nMy husband chose a burger, which was overall very good, although they charged him two dollars each for bacon and cheese on the burger, which is expensive when your burger is already $15. Not sure the bacon added anything, but the cheese, I'll admit was really good on this burger. \n\nAtmosphere and Service: Service was fine. BUT, since this seems to be a trend...or the gods are intent on making me detest children while eating out, we had another loud, rude child\/negligent parent situation (see post on Malaysian place).

The group of older individuals across from us kept leaning over to make comments to us and the two ladies nearby grumbled under their breath. \n\nOnce again, this was a problem that could easily have been solved by the restaurant. The kids were part of a party and were in a party room, which is adjacent, but separate from the rest of the dining room. This room had doors on it...which CLOSE, but were propped wide open. All the waitress had to do was go and quietly shut the doors. That's it! Problem solved. \n\nWe were getting annoyed and so we didn't bother ordering dessert. Too bad, because they actually looked great. The group across from us ordered a few and were commenting on how good they were.\n\nSo yeah...I actually would have given this pub 2 stars even without the screaming kid, but if the screaming kid had not been a problem, we probably would have stayed for dessert and who knows, maybe these guys would be getting 3+ stars.

Granted there are only 4 as I am writing this, but still they seemed pretty consistent. \n\nWe have driven by this place a million times and never given it a second glance, but based on the reviews, off we went to give it a try.\n\nFirst impressions were pretty good. We were seated right away in a large booth. The restaurant was clean and modern looking, although covered in Halloween decorations, despite it being November 10. \n\nMenu looked pretty good, with lots of selection. The front of the menu is the desserts, which seem to be why most people come here. But we wanted dinner as well. I ordered the shrimp wonton soup and my husband ordered chicken and mushrooms with rice. \n\nWe both ordered drinks. I ordered a tea and my husband ordered a mango smoothie. \n\nMy drink came out...then my soup came out...neither of my husbands orders came. It took another fifteen minutes for his food to come and his drink came after that! No apologies for the wait. \n\nMy soup was pretty basic. The noodles had no taste and a sticky texture. It was bland overall, but not terrible. My drink was good, but small, given the $6 price tag for a tea. \n\nMy husbands dish was just gross. The chicken were little balls that looked like chicken fetuses. Maybe they were?? Filled with bones, making them very difficult to eat. The taste was bland and salty. \n\nHis drink was good, but the straw didn't reach to the bottom of the glass...which wasn't a glass at all, but a wine decanter. He couldn't reach his drink about half-way through and had to borrow my straw.\n\nWe finished our meals and started waiting...and waiting and waiting. No one had come to check and see how our meals were and we had to flag someone down to clear the dishes. A girl finally came to go it and did so without looking, or asking if there was anything else she could get for us, or if we wanted refills. \n\nWe REALLY wanted to give this place the benefit of the doubt, so we decided to stick it out and order dessert, since it seemed to be what this place was all about. \n\nWe flagged someone down and ordered mixed fruit on a waffle. The presentation of the dish was certainly nice, but it's pretty generic. It's a basic belgian waffle with vanilla ice cream, strawberries, bananas and some melon balls and cool whip whipped cream on top and a sort of Aunt Jemima syrup. \n\nIt was pretty good, but nothing special.\n\nOnce we finished we flagged someone down to get our bill. He said yes and left...and never came back. We saw his give other people bills and get food...he basically completely forgot about us. We waited for 15 minutes. We started looking around to figure out what happened and noticed that the wait staff were just chilling in the back of the restaurant. One girl was staring aimlessly at the ceiling. Two others were holding hands and swinging their arms in time to the music. Two guys were back there chatting away...it was actually weird. \n\nFinally, we managed to flag down yet a DIFFERENT waitress...this was number 6 (one seated us, one took our order, one cleared the dishes, one took the dessert order and one went to get our bill...apparently, and now this one) and asked her to get our bill. She finally did. We paid...we left a tip (we try hard not be be jerks, even if the service is poor) and left...never to return. \n\nSo yeah, bland food, generic desserts and TERRIBLE service = not worth it. \n\nOne another note, another review says, \"If you're into young asian girls (and guys), this is the place to hang out.\" I KNOW this person meant nothing by this comment, but I swear there is some creepy dude who has done a Google search of \"Places where young Asian girls and boys hang out\" and found this place based on that review...so you know...probably some creepers hanging around as well. Just sayin'! (*Note: This comment, as creepy as it was, had no baring on my review).","useful":1,"funny":3,"cool":1}

Since I have been several times and never had a bad experience, I can only give my review of this place based on what I have experienced. \n\nThat said, it seems like so many people have experienced bad service, that even I am wary of this place now. I have never been during \"peak\" hours, which may account for more attentive service.\n\nAs mentioned, I have been to this restaurant several times and really enjoyed myself. I love Mexican food and there doesn't seem to be enough good Mexican restaurants around, so I get excited when I find one with food I enjoy.\n\nI have had their nachos, two types of tacos and a burrito at this place and enjoyed all of them. When I went with a girlfriend, we were advised to get two taco plates and share them, since they give you a few, small tacos on each plate. We did this and really enjoyed both dishes. \n\nThe nachos were also great, having been piled high with toppings, not just your grated cheese and some tomatoes. \n\nDrinks were also good. I guess my one criticism would be the price, which I do think is a little high given that Mexican food is quite cheap to produce. I am guessing that the extra cost goes towards the atmosphere, which is trendy...but I gave this same review to another Mexican restaurant I went to in Florida and it looked like someone's kitchen, so I guess it's all in the eye of the beholder.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":2}

The drummers just sort of jam together, playing all sorts of different types of drums and bongos. People go and dance in the middle...kids go and pound on the drums...lots of people get high! \n\nEven not high, this is a pretty fun thing to watch. It's mesmerizing somehow. Again, I can't explain what made this so great.

Actually, it's better that it's not. I would get truly obese if it were, because my new diet would consist of fried dough, sauce and cheese.\nMy husband and myself went to Sail and were looking for a place to pick up some dinner...just grab and go, since I had no groceries at home...but also didn't have the energy to go grocery shopping. I lay in a hammock (I was in Sail, what else would I do?) I researched places to get sandwiches in the area and this place came up and had good reviews. I mentioned to my husband as we were checking out and the check out guy said, \"There is this good place nearby named Ricci's.\" That sealed the deal. Off we went.\n\nThe outside is hardly something to look at. The sign is faded and dirty and it looks, outside, like it's a dive. We went in a saw a modestly busy place, clean and a HUGE menu. You can eat in (seating is limited and similar to fast food seating), can get delivery, or get take out. \n\nThe menu is extensive, with pasta, pizza and panzerotti. We went with what many people were raving about online and got panzerotti...fried ones. OH GOD HEART ATTACK. We also got the rice balls.\n\nOkay, rice balls first: Lightly breaded, gooey cheese on the inside and sauce for dipping them in....SO GOOD.\n\nThe panzerotti...well this is where they lose one star...not on the food itself, but because they messed up our order. One order was covered in a sheet of wax paper with the toppings listed on the inside...it was mine. But after a few bites I noticed, I was actually eating my husband's. We switched and then i noticed there were no toppings in mine at all! Just cheese and sauce. So they were mislabelled AND the order was messed up. \n\nBut OH LORDY, was that a great panzerotti anyway. Just melt in your mouth awesome....and that's after a 30 minute drive home! \n\nI called up Ricci's and explained what happened and said I was too far away to come in again or to have something delivered and they gave me a credit for the panzerotti. The girl on the phone apologized and was very polite. So they fixed the problem to the best of their ability and it was amazingly delicious. Next time if I go back and the order it great...and not messed up, I think I'll have to bump these guys up another star! \n\nOhhhh man, get me BACK there!","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":0}

If you need anything alien related this is definitely the place to go.\n\nIt seemed out of place in Boulder City to me. I mean I don't think Boulder City is exactly a UFO hot bed but still I wish them well.\n\nDefinitely an interesting store to visit.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I ordered a chicken sandwich combo to go.\n\nThe two guys working the front counter had the enthusiasm of a couple of rocks. It looked like it was an effort for them to even take a step. I understand it's probably not the best job in the world but there are people like me who recruit our employees from people we run into during our day to day activities. These two have zero chances of being recruited to work somewhere else.\n\nI also had to ask for the fries that went with my combo. I got them, but only after a heavy sigh from one of the two at the counter. You would have thought I'd asked him to come outside and change my tire rather then just asking them for a bag of fries.\n\nThe food was mediocre, probably a three. But the lack of enthusiastic service definitely drops it to a two.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Bar was packed. We managed to squeeze up to the bar and order a drink. We had to take our drinks to a table as there was nowhere at the bar to sit.\n\nThe bartender noticed us as soon as we came in. This is a plus. Seems a lot of bartenders tend to ignore you for awhile unless you're a regular.\n\nWe also ordered a basket of fries which were quite tasty.\n\nSo why only a 3 star rating? We're new to the area and we're looking for a friendly type of bar. A place where customers actually talk to each other rather than hunch over their poker machines.\n\nThis place is nice enough but it's made from the same mold as many of the bars in Vegas.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}
